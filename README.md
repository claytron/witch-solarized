# Witch Solarized

I like options. [Witch][witch] gives me a ton of options. If you are not
satisfied with Command-Tab on OS X, you should check it out. I recently
switched over and couldn't resist setting up some [Solarized][solar]
color schemes.

## Install

To install, first [download][download] the `witchlayout` files.

Then apply the theme you want:

`System Preferences` > `Witch` > `Appearance` > `Presets...` > `Open`

And select the `witchlayout` background you desire. Light or Dark.
